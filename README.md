An overview of Supply Chain Management Automation: Benefits,  Drawbacks, and Implementation Challenges

Supply chain management (SCM) automation has become increasingly important for firms looking to improve their efficiency and competitiveness in today's global market. However, the implementation of SCM automation presents both benefits and drawbacks and requires careful consideration of the challenges and considerations involved. This paper reviews the literature on SCM automation, focusing on three key research questions: the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing SCM automation in a large multinational corporation, how emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain can be integrated into existing SCM automation systems, and the key challenges and considerations involved in implementing SCM automation in small-sized startups and industries and medium-sized industries. The literature review provides some insights on the implementation of SCM automation in large multinational corporations can result in significant benefits, such as improved efficiency, cost reduction, and enhanced customer satisfaction. However, it also presents certain drawbacks, including the need for significant investment in technology and infrastructure, the potential for disruption to existing workflows, and the risk of job displacement. Effective change management strategies and communication plans are necessary to ensure the successful adoption and integration of SCM automation in large firms. The integration of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain into existing SCM automation systems has the potential to significantly improve supply chain visibility, efficiency, and responsiveness. AI can be used for demand forecasting, inventory management, and transportation optimization, while blockchain can enhance transparency, traceability, and security. However, the implementation of these technologies requires careful consideration of the organizational and technical challenges involved, including data quality, standardization, and interoperability. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have particular difficulties and issues when implementing SCM automation, such as a lack of resources, a lack of knowledge, and resistance to change. To overcome these challenges, it is important to develop tailored strategies that take into account the specific needs and constraints of SMEs, such as modular solutions and cloudbased systems. Additionally, fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration can help SMEs to embrace the benefits of SCM automation and overcome resistance to change.
